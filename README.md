*Fancy Feature* 
Located in recipegen.ejs for inclusion and code for animation located in js/animation.js 
- Tried various animation aspects including an x axis rotation, and a defered loading. However- it would not rotate 180 degress and instead would go between L/R and end up upside down.


**Shoutouts** 
Jess- For rallying the team and keeping everybody on track and helping absolutely everyone with questions 
Xia- For being the first to have his code finished and being on top of things
Boxiang- For finishing up the final details and all the outside missing elements 
Ellie- For a disgusting buttermilk petri dish drawing
